# Post-Mortem Report: Import Resolution Incident (21 Jul 2025)

## 1. Incident Summary
On July 21, 2025, during development of the Focus-Loop web application, the development server and automated tests began failing immediately after adding a new "skip" feature. Next.js reported "Module not found: Can't resolve '@focus-loop/core-timers'", and Vitest tests across multiple components threw "Objects are not valid as a React child" errors due to unresolved imports. The incident was first detected when developers saw build errors in the terminal and red test runs in continuous integration.

## 2. Impact
- Development server failed to start, causing downtime for frontend developers.
- All component and integration tests (28) failed, blocking CI builds and merges.
- Estimated developer hours wasted: 4 hours.
- Potential delayed release of the next feature milestone.

## 3. Timeline of Events
- **2025-07-21 09:15**: Added `onSkip` prop and updated imports in `TimerControls` and `TimerContainer` components.
- **2025-07-21 09:20**: Ran `npm dev`; Next.js failed with module resolution errors for `@focus-loop/core-timers`.
- **2025-07-21 09:25**: Ran Vitest; 28 tests failed with React child errors related to incorrect imports.
- **2025-07-21 09:30**: Investigation began; confirmed missing path/alias configuration for workspace package.
- **2025-07-21 10:00**: Attempted temporary fix by adjusting `tsconfig.json` paths; tests still failing.
- **2025-07-21 11:00**: Identified root cause: Next.js and Vitest lacked proper module resolution for the monorepo package.
- **2025-07-21 11:30**: Rolled back recent import changes to restore baseline functionality.
- **2025-07-21 12:00**: Planned and applied proper fix: updated `tsconfig.json` and `vitest.config.ts` with correct paths/aliases.

## 4. Root Cause Analysis
- **Problem Statement:** The root cause was missing module resolution configuration for the `@focus-loop/core-timers` workspace package in both Next.js and Vitest.
- **Evidence:** Build error "Can't resolve '@focus-loop/core-timers'" in Next.js; Vitest errors complaining about invalid React child objects due to unresolved imports returning unexpected values.
- **Reasoning (Warrant):** Without explicit `paths` mappings in `tsconfig.json` and alias settings in Vitest, the monorepo package could not be located at runtime or during tests, causing import failures and misrendered components.
- **Contributing Factors:**
  - Monorepo setup requires explicit path/alias configuration for workspace packages.
  - Tests used CommonJS `require()` on ES modules, leading to loader mismatches.
  - Lack of CI validation of dev-server startup and test suite integrity on new workspace imports.

## 5. Resolution
1. Rolled back the skip-related import changes to restore service.
2. Updated root and `apps/web` `tsconfig.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "compilerOptions": {
       "baseUrl": ".",
       "paths": {
         "@focus-loop/core-timers": ["../../packages/core-timers/src"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
3. Added alias to `vitest.config.ts`:
   ```ts
   resolve: {
     alias: {
       '@focus-loop/core-timers': '/absolute/path/to/packages/core-timers/src'
     }
   }
   ```
4. Verified Next.js dev server starts successfully and all Vitest tests pass.

## 6. Preventive Measures
- Add a CI step to verify module resolution in Next.js and Vitest on pull requests.
- Document monorepo `tsconfig` paths and Vitest alias configuration in `docs/projectplan.md`.
- Establish a development guideline: update `tsconfig.paths` and test aliases whenever importing a new workspace package.
- Implement integration tests that start the dev server and run the full test suite in CI to catch import errors early.
