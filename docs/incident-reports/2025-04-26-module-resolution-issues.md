# Module Resolution Incident Report
**Date**: April 26, 2025 
**Status**: Active  
**Severity**: High  
**Affected Systems**: Focus-Loop Monorepo

## Incident Summary
The Focus-Loop monorepo is experiencing critical module resolution issues affecting both development and testing environments. The core issue stems from inconsistent module resolution between the Next.js application and the core-timers package, leading to test failures and potential runtime errors.

## Impact
- Test failures in React components
- Inconsistent module resolution between development and production builds
- Potential runtime errors in the application
- Development workflow disruption
- Increased debugging time

## Current Architecture Analysis

### Core Issues
1. **Module Resolution Inconsistency**
   - Next.js and Vitest using different module resolution strategies
   - Path aliases not properly configured across the monorepo
   - Inconsistent file extensions in imports

2. **Package Structure Mismatch**
   - `core-timers` package using CommonJS exports
   - Next.js application expecting ESM modules
   - Type definitions not properly aligned with implementation

3. **Testing Environment Configuration**
   - Vitest configuration not properly handling monorepo dependencies
   - Mock implementations not matching actual package structure
   - Test environment not properly simulating production module resolution

## Potential Solutions

### Solution 1: Unified Module System
**Description**: Convert the entire monorepo to use ESM exclusively and implement proper module resolution.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Convert `core-timers` to ESM
2. Update all package.json files to use `"type": "module"`
3. Implement proper path aliases in tsconfig.json
4. Update Vitest configuration to match Next.js module resolution
5. Create proper type definitions for all packages

**Pros**:
- Consistent module resolution across the stack
- Better TypeScript support
- Modern JavaScript features available
- Easier debugging and maintenance

**Cons**:
- Significant refactoring required
- Potential breaking changes
- Longer implementation time
- Need to update all dependencies

### Solution 2: Hybrid Approach with Adapters
**Description**: Maintain current module systems but implement adapters to bridge the differences.

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Create ESM wrapper for `core-timers`
2. Implement proper type definitions
3. Update Vitest configuration to use the wrapper
4. Add runtime checks for module compatibility
5. Create adapter layer for testing

**Pros**:
- Less disruptive to existing code
- Faster implementation
- Can be done incrementally
- Maintains backward compatibility

**Cons**:
- More complex architecture
- Additional maintenance overhead
- Potential performance impact
- May mask underlying issues

## Recommendation

**Primary Recommendation**: Implement Solution 1 (Unified Module System)

**Rationale**:
1. Long-term maintainability
2. Better developer experience
3. Reduced complexity
4. Future-proof architecture
5. Better tooling support

**Implementation Priority**:
1. High - Module resolution issues are blocking development
2. Critical - Affects both development and production environments
3. Urgent - Test failures are preventing proper CI/CD

## Next Steps
1. Create detailed implementation plan for Solution 1
2. Set up proper testing infrastructure
3. Implement changes in small, testable increments
4. Update documentation
5. Create rollback plan

## Monitoring Plan
1. Track test coverage during implementation
2. Monitor build times
3. Track developer feedback
4. Measure performance impact
5. Document any new issues

## Timeline
- Planning: 1 day
- Implementation: 3-5 days
- Testing: 2-3 days
- Documentation: 1 day
- Total: 7-10 days

## Risk Assessment
- High: Module resolution issues could cause production failures
- Medium: Implementation complexity
- Low: Performance impact
- Low: User impact (development only)

## Stakeholders
- Development Team
- QA Team
- DevOps Team
- Product Management
